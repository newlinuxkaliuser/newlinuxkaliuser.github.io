## Activities
One highlight of the week was utilizing the **AGILE** planning method to create a roller coaster out of straws. This hands-on activity not only showcased the importance of teamwork and communication but also allowed me to grasp the practical application of agile methodologies in a fun and engaging manner.

Moreover, my interest in **Linux** has been reignited during this week. Learning about RedHat's Linux distributions and observing how they are utilized in real-world scenarios has inspired me to delve deeper into the world of Linux. I have even started learning **bash scripts** at home, eager to expand my knowledge and skill set in this area.
